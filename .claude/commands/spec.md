# Spec Interview

Interview the user to create or update SPEC.md for this project.

## Process

1. **Check for existing SPEC.md** - If it exists, read it first and ask if this is an update or fresh start.

2. **Gather core information through questions:**
   - What is this project? (one sentence)
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Who is the target user?
   - What are the key features/capabilities?
   - What are explicit non-goals (things this will NOT do)?
   - What technologies/stack are you using or prefer?
   - Are there constraints (performance, compatibility, licensing)?

3. **Write SPEC.md** in the project root with sections:
   - Overview (what and why)
   - Goals
   - Non-goals
   - Technical approach
   - Key decisions made
   - Open questions

4. **Confirm with user** before writing. Ask if anything is missing.

## When to invoke this

- At project start
- After conversation compaction when context is lost
- When requirements change significantly
- When user says "let's update the spec"
