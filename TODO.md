## To-do (Arch)

- [] Keyboard not being recognized at GRUB boot screen
- [] When an external display gets disconnected, the display recognition does not reset, as if they were still there
- [] Bind display mapping to something like `$mod+Shift+l exec --no-startup-id xrandr --output HDMI-1 --left-of eDP-1 --output HDMI-1 --primary` and `$mod+Shift+u exec_always --no-startup-id xrandr --output HDMI-1 --above eDP-1 --output HDMI-1 --primary` etc.
- [] Set default audio output device for Firefox to Galaxy Buds Pro
- [] `clipse` doesn't save copied content in it's history
